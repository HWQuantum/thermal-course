# Thermal Physics Simulations

Welcome to the course site.  This course will investigate several concepts in thermal physics and use different numerical techniques to solve complicated problems.  The course is based around four labs.  These are simulating entropy increases via convection and conduction; solving the heat diffusion equation via the finite-differnce method; solving the heat diffusion equation using Fourier transforms; and simulating the temperature dependence of magnetism via the Ising model.

The numerical methods that we will be using include Monte Carlo methods, finite-differnce methods, and Fourier-based methods.  While we use these methods to solve problems in thermal physics, they are general techniques that are used across many areas of physics and engineering.
