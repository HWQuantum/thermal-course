# Thermal Physics Simulations

Welcome to the course site.  This course will investigate several concperts in thermal physics and use different numerical techniques to solve complicated problems.  The numerical methods that we will be using include Monte Carlo methods, finite-differnce methods, and Fourier-based methods.  While we use these methods to solve problems in thermal physics, they are general techniques that are used across many areas of physics and engineering.
