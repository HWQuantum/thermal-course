The simulation will show how a system with several hot particles separated from cold particles evolves as the particles mix and exchange energy.  We will start by initialising an array of N particles with the hot particles originally separated from the cold particles.  As time evolves, neighbouring particles can either swap positions, representing convection, or they can exchange energy, representing conduction.  We find that the entropy increases with time, reflecting a loss of spatial information about where the hot particles are.  This is an example of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of a closed system will increase or remain constant with time.\n\nThis simulation is an example of predictable macroscopic behaviour emerging from simple rules of microscopic states.  We can make some simple assumptions about how two neighbouring particles might interact with each other, and then observe how these influence the properties of the combined system.\n\nIn this case, we the only update rule that we apply is that neighbouring particles can either swap locations (simulating convection) or exchange and average their energies (simulating conduction).  These simple rules then result in a predictable increase in entropy associated with the location of the heat in a system.  An important outcome is that we can be confident of the long-term behaviour of the system (increase in entropy), but we cannot predict what will happen in any one time step (the entropy may go up or down).","type":"content","url":"/lab1#overview","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 — Entropy Mixing","lvl3":"Learning Outcomes","lvl2":"Thermal Physics Lab 1 — Entropy Increase Due to Convection and Conduction"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/lab1#learning-outcomes","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 — Entropy Mixing","lvl3":"Learning Outcomes","lvl2":"Thermal Physics Lab 1 — Entropy Increase Due to Convection and Conduction"},"content":"By the end of this lab you should be able to:\n\nSimulate convection and/or conduction of heat via simple update rules.\n\nDescribe entropy as a measure of spatial distribution of energy.\n\nUnderstand that small fluctuations can temporarily reduce entropy.\n\nExplain how microscopic randomness produces predictable macroscopic behaviour.","type":"content","url":"/lab1#learning-outcomes","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 — Entropy Mixing","lvl2":"Background"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/lab1#background","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 — Entropy Mixing","lvl2":"Background"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/lab1#background","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 — Entropy Mixing","lvl3":"Shannon Entropy","lvl2":"Background"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/lab1#shannon-entropy","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 — Entropy Mixing","lvl3":"Shannon Entropy","lvl2":"Background"},"content":"The Shannon entropy isS = -\\sum_i p_i \\log_2 p_i\n\nwhere p_i is the probability of a random event occurring.\n\nUsing \\log_2 gives entropy in bits.","type":"content","url":"/lab1#shannon-entropy","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 — Entropy Mixing","lvl3":"Gibbs and Boltzmann Entropy","lvl2":"Background"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/lab1#gibbs-and-boltzmann-entropy","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 — Entropy Mixing","lvl3":"Gibbs and Boltzmann Entropy","lvl2":"Background"},"content":"In statistical mechanics,S = -k_B \\sum_i p_i \\ln p_i\n\nIf all microstates are equally probable, p_i = 1/\\Omega, givingS = k_B \\ln \\Omega.\n\nIf \\Omega = 1, then S = 0.","type":"content","url":"/lab1#gibbs-and-boltzmann-entropy","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 — Entropy Mixing","lvl3":"Second Law of Thermodynamics","lvl2":"Background"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/lab1#second-law-of-thermodynamics","position":14},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 — Entropy Mixing","lvl3":"Second Law of Thermodynamics","lvl2":"Background"},"content":"For an isolated system,\\Delta S_{\\text{total}} \\ge 0.\n\nEntropy increases until equilibrium is reached.","type":"content","url":"/lab1#second-law-of-thermodynamics","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 — Entropy Mixing","lvl3":"Convection vs Conduction","lvl2":"Background"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/lab1#convection-vs-conduction","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 — Entropy Mixing","lvl3":"Convection vs Conduction","lvl2":"Background"},"content":"Convection → swap neighbouring particles.\n\nConduction → average neighbouring energies.","type":"content","url":"/lab1#convection-vs-conduction","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 — Entropy Mixing","lvl2":"Simulation Details"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/lab1#simulation-details","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 — Entropy Mixing","lvl2":"Simulation Details"},"content":"\n\nSchematic illustration of entropy increase during mixing.","type":"content","url":"/lab1#simulation-details","position":19}]}
