We then calculate properties associated with the system, e.g. the Gibbs entropy associated with the temperature distribution, and then plot and analyse the results.  Strictly, the Gibbs entropy uses the microstates of a system, but it is often not possible to know or count all of the microstates of a system.  In such a case, we can use a coarse-grained version where we calculate the fraction of total energy (or hot particle content) in spatial region i.\n\nTo achieve this, we will divide the total system into several (2 or 4) regions, and calculate the probability of finding a hot particle in each region.  We always require a probability distribution to calculate entropy, and we will use the probability distribution of heat in this simulation in the Gibbs formulation.  The heat probability distribution provides the necessary information about “where the heat is in the system,” which is what is needed to calculate the entropy.","type":"content","url":"/lab1#simulation-details","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 - Entropy Increase","lvl2":"Physical Interpretation"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/lab1#physical-interpretation","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 - Entropy Increase","lvl2":"Physical Interpretation"},"content":"\n\nFigure 1:Schematic illustration of the simulation.  We start with an initial distribution of cold particles on the left and hot particles on the right.  The probability distribution measures where we find the hot particles.  At t = 0, these are all on the right-hand side, and this corresponds to an entropy of 0 bits.  As t increases, we update the distribution and calculate S_t.   After many iterations, the entropy will tend to the maximum value, S_{t>10^6} \\approx k_B \\ln 2 = 0.69~k_B.\n\nFor a system with distinguishable regions and energy distribution, entropy can be related to our ability to localize energy (e.g., hot particles). The entropy measures the distribution of this energy throughout the system\n\nAt the start of this simulation, all hot particles are on the right and all cold particles on the left, therefore, the system is highly ordered and low in entropy. As particles move and mix, it becomes increasingly difficult to determine where the hot particles are, indicating an increase in entropy. As particles swap places and energy becomes more uniformly distributed, the number of possible microstates increases, and so too does the entropy.\n\nThis is exactly what is contained in the second law of thermodynamics, which states that in an isolated system, entropy tends to increase with time. In our simulation, there is no energy input or output, and yet the system evolves from a low-entropy state (localized energy) to a high-entropy state (spread-out energy). The entropy increase is a direct result of this spatial delocalization.","type":"content","url":"/lab1#physical-interpretation","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 - Entropy Increase","lvl2":"Pseudo Code"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/lab1#pseudo-code","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 - Entropy Increase","lvl2":"Pseudo Code"},"content":"Algorithm\n\nEntropy Mixing Simulation (1D)\n\nInitialisation\n\nInitialise a vector v of length N (e.g 100) with values 0 on the left for cold and 1 on the right for hot.\n\nSet the total number of time steps T (e.g. 10,000), set the number of bins B for entropy calculation (e.g. 2, 4, or 8), and initialise a vector of length T to store entropy values S.

The simulation will show how a system with several hot particles separated from cold particles evolves as the particles mix and exchange energy.  We will start by initialising an array of N particles with the hot particles originally separated from the cold particles.  As time evolves, neighbouring particles can either swap positions, representing convection, or they can exchange energy, representing conduction.  We find that the entropy increases with time, reflecting a loss of spatial information about where the hot particles are.  This is an example of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of a closed system will increase or remain constant with time.\n\nThis simulation is an example of predictable macroscopic behaviour emerging from simple rules of microscopic states.
