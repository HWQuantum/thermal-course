The simulation will show how a system with several hot particles separated from cold particles evolves as the particles mix and exchange energy.  We will start by initialising an array of N particles with the hot particles originally separated from the cold particles.  As time evolves, neighbouring particles can either swap positions, representing convection, or they can exchange energy, representing conduction.  We find that the entropy increases with time, reflecting a loss of spatial information about where the hot particles are.  This is an example of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of a closed system will increase or remain constant with time.\n\nThis simulation is an example of predictable macroscopic behaviour emerging from simple rules of microscopic states.  We can make some simple assumptions about how two neighbouring particles might interact with each other, and then observe how these influence the properties of the combined system.\n\nIn this case, we the only update rule that we apply is that neighbouring particles can either swap locations (simulating convection) or exchange and average their energies (simulating conduction).  These simple rules then result in a predictable increase in entropy associated with the location of the heat in a system.  An important outcome is that we can be confident of the long-term behaviour of the system (increase in entropy), but we cannot predict what will happen in any one time step (the entropy may go up or down).","type":"content","url":"/lab1#overview","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 - Entropy Increase","lvl3":"How will you be assessed?","lvl2":"Overview"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/lab1#how-will-you-be-assessed","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 - Entropy Increase","lvl3":"How will you be assessed?","lvl2":"Overview"},"content":"At the end of the lab, you will hand in a single MATLAB .m file that contains your simulation and generates your results.

The entropy measures the distribution of this energy throughout the system\n\nAt the start of this simulation, all hot particles are on the right and all cold particles on the left, therefore, the system is highly ordered and low in entropy. As particles move and mix, it becomes increasingly difficult to determine where the hot particles are, indicating an increase in entropy. As particles swap places and energy becomes more uniformly distributed, the number of possible microstates increases, and so too does the entropy.\n\nThis is exactly what is contained in the second law of thermodynamics, which states that in an isolated system, entropy tends to increase with time. In our simulation, there is no energy input or output, and yet the system evolves from a low-entropy state (localized energy) to a high-entropy state (spread-out energy). The entropy increase is a direct result of this spatial delocalization.","type":"content","url":"/lab1#physical-interpretation","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 - Entropy Increase","lvl2":"Pseudo Code"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/lab1#pseudo-code","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Lab 1 - Entropy Increase","lvl2":"Pseudo Code"},"content":"Algorithm\n\nEntropy Mixing Simulation (1D)\n\nInitialisation\n\nInitialise a vector v of length N (e.g 100) with values 0 on the left for cold and 1 on the right for hot.\n\nSet the total number of time steps T (e.g. 10,000), set the number of bins B for entropy calculation (e.g. 2, 4, or 8), and initialise a vector of length T to store entropy values S.

The simulation will show how a system with several hot particles separated from cold particles evolves as the particles mix and exchange energy.  We will start by initialising an array of N particles with the hot particles originally separated from the cold particles.  As time evolves, neighbouring particles can either swap positions, representing convection, or they can exchange energy, representing conduction.  We find that the entropy increases with time, reflecting a loss of spatial information about where the hot particles are.  This is an example of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of a closed system will increase or remain constant with time.\n\nThis simulation is an example of predictable macroscopic behaviour emerging from simple rules of microscopic states.
