# Lab 2 - The Heat Diffusion Equation - Finite Difference
# Overview

In this lab, we will simulate the diffusion of heat in a one-dimensional rod using the finite difference method. The goal is to numerically solve the heat equation and observe how temperature evolves over time. We will discretise both space and time, apply appropriate boundary conditions, and explore the stability of the numerical method.

This simulation demonstrates how a continuous differential equation can be approximated by discrete update rules. By implementing the finite difference method, we observe how heat spreads from regions of high temperature to regions of low temperature.

## How will you be assessed?

At the end of the lab, you will submit a single MATLAB .m file that performs the simulation and generates the required plots. Your code should be clearly commented to demonstrate understanding of the numerical method and the underlying physics.

In order to pass this lab, your code must:

- Correctly implement the finite difference method
- Produce physically reasonable results
- Include appropriate plots with labelled axes

This is a pass/fail lab.

# Background

The problem that we will solve is given an initial spatial temperature distribution at time = 0, what is the temperature distribution at time = $t$?

## One dimensional diffusion equation

The heat diffusion equation (or simply, the heat equation) describes how heat flows in a medium over time. In one dimension, it is given by:
%
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial T(x,t)}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 T(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
\end{align}
%
where $T(x,t)$ is the temperature at position $x$ and time $t$, and $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity.  This equation assumes that we have a constant thermal diffusivity $\alpha$, there are no internal heat source, and this for the one-dimensional case (e.g. a rod).  Simple modifications of the equation can introduce additional features, such as internal sources of heat, and the same concepts are applied when solving the equation in 2 and 3 dimensions. 

## Two dimensional diffusion equation

The two-dimensional diffusion equation is given by
%
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial T(x, y, t)}{\partial t} = \alpha \left( \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial y^2} \right) = \alpha \nabla^2 T.
\end{align}

## Finite Difference Approximation

The heat diffusion equation is solved by taking the current distribution given by $T(x, t)$ and adding $\alpha$ times the curvature in space times $\Delta t$.
```

To find a numerical solution, we discretize the heat equation using the finite-difference method. If we discretize time in to steps of size $\Delta t$ and leave space continuous, we see that 
%
\begin{align}\label{solution}
\frac{\partial T(x,t)}{\partial t} \approx \frac{T(x, t+\Delta t)-T(x, t)}{\Delta t} & =  \alpha \frac{\partial^2 T(x, t)}{\partial x^2} ,\\
\rightarrow T(x, t+\Delta t) & = T(x, t) +\alpha \frac{\partial^2 T(x, t)}{\partial x^2} \Delta t,
\end{align}
%
which, in words, means that the temperature distribution $T(x)$ at time $t + \Delta t $ is equal to the current temperature distribution plus $\alpha$ times the curvature in space times $\Delta t$.  We can then define a grid with spatial steps $\Delta x$, so that the numerically evaluated curvature is equal to 
%
\begin{align}\label{solution}
\frac{\partial^2 T(x,t)}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{\frac{  T({x+1},t) - T(x,t)}{\Delta x}-\frac{  T(x,t) - T(x-1,t)}{\Delta x}}{\Delta x} =  \frac{  T({x+1},t) - 2T(x,t) + T(x-1,t) }{(\Delta x)^2}
\end{align}
%
A visual guide to equation \ref{solution} is given in figure \ref{derivatives}.  This means that the discrete version of the equation becomes:
%
\begin{align}
T(x,{t+\Delta t}) = T(x, t) + \alpha \frac{   T({x+1},t) - 2T(x,t) + T(x-1,t) }{(\Delta x)^2} \Delta t.
\end{align}
%
This is often written as
%
\begin{align}
T_i^{n+1} = T_i^n + \alpha \frac{\Delta t}{(\Delta x)^2} \left( T_{i+1}^n - 2T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n \right),
\end{align}
%
where the $x$ spatial position is replaced with the index $i$, and the time $t$ is replaced with the temopral index $n$.  This is useful when using a computer to solve the equation numerically.

Visual aid for how the numerical gradient and curvature of a function are calculated numerically.  The gradient is the difference between the function's values on either side of the point of interest divided by $2 \Delta x$.  The curvature is the difference in the gradient on either side of the point of interest divided by $\Delta x$.

## Stability Condition

For stability of the explicit method, we require:

$$
r \le \frac{1}{2}.
$$

If this condition is violated, the numerical solution becomes unstable.

# Simulation Details

You will simulate heat diffusion along a rod of length $L$.

1. Discretise the rod into $N$ spatial points.
2. Choose a time step $\Delta t$ satisfying the stability condition.
3. Apply boundary conditions (e.g., fixed temperature at both ends).
4. Evolve the temperature distribution over time.

---

## Physical Interpretation

Heat flows from regions of high temperature to low temperature. The finite difference method allows us to approximate this process numerically. Over time, sharp temperature gradients smooth out, and the system approaches thermal equilibrium.

The rate of diffusion depends on the thermal diffusivity $\alpha$. Larger values of $\alpha$ lead to faster smoothing of temperature differences.

**Heat Diffusion Simulation (1D Finite Difference)**

**Initialisation**

1. Define rod length $L$ and number of spatial points $N$.
2. Define thermal diffusivity $\alpha$.
3. Choose spatial step size $\Delta x = L/(N-1)$.
4. Choose time step $\Delta t$ such that
   $$
   r = \frac{\alpha \Delta t}{(\Delta x)^2} \le \frac{1}{2}.
   $$
5. Initialise temperature vector $T$ with chosen initial condition.
6. Apply boundary conditions.

**Time Evolution**

For each time step $n$:

1. For each interior point $i = 2, \dots, N-1$:
   $$
   T_i^{n+1}
   =
   T_i^n
   +
   r \left( T_{i+1}^n - 2T_i^n + T_{i-1}^n \right)
   $$

2. Apply boundary conditions to $T^{n+1}$.
3. Store temperature profile if required.
4. Plot temperature profile at chosen intervals.
